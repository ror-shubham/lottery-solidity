# lottery-solidity
Part of an assignment-  
A simplified lottery contract using truffle framework: - 
* In the constructor the owner of the contract sends a SHa3 hash of the winning guess between 1 and 1'000'000 - 
* In order to participate a user sends 1 ETH to the contract and gets 1 participation token. 
* If the user sends more than 1 ETH the get 1 token per ETH sent 
* If the user sends a fraction of ETH, the excess is returned to them 
* The contract has a 'makeGuess' function which accepts a number between 1 and 1â€™000'000 
* When makeGuess is called one token is deducted from the user's balance 
* The call to makeGuess fails if the user has insufficient balance 
* The contract has a closeGame function that can only be called by the owner 
* Calling the closeGame makes it impossible to send ETH to the contract or call makeGuess 
* The unused tokens are not reimbursed (for simplicity) - 
* A function winnerAddress will return the address of the winner once the game is closed 
* Once the game is closed the winner can call getPrice to collect 50% of the ETH in the contract 
* The getPrice function sends the remaining 50% of ETH to the owner of the contract
